<!-- first need react.js cdn and also react-dom.js cdn
then we need the babel transpiler because React is written in JSX, JSX is not understood by the browser which only understands JS, so the transpiler translates the JSX into JS to be understood by the browser, in this case an older transpiler of babel 5.8.24 works with this app-->
<!-- script tag where React code will be written will have type="text/babel"
-->
<!--Render basically takes a bit of html and places it into a target where you want to display it, in this case, the id="example"
the first parameter is just html, in this case, h1, this is also basically our React component
the next parameter and the only other one it takes is where we're going to display this, in this case the div with the id of example, via document.GetElementById which will take our React code which in this case is h1 Marco and display into the div with the id of example-->
<!-- Components are just part of the website, anything that's part of a website that's made with React are made with components, so the entire app is made up of components (just different parts of the webpage)
to make a component is via making a variable ___ = React.createClass and inside that is where we actually create the component, since a component is just essentially part of the website, all it is, is pretty much html
so in this case, all it needs to do is return some html, we do this with a function called render, in this case we're returning an h2 component
so whenever we use the component Bacon, it displays an h2
so now we want to substitute the h1 Marco with the component Bacon to display an h2, we literally just substitute the component Bacon in a self-closing tag form <Bacon/> and it will display the h2
so now the component Bacon will the h2 in the target element id="example"
Basically the entire application will be made up of individual parts called components.
At the heart of a component, it essentially just returns a chunk of html-->
<!--Now for returning multiple components...
Be mindful of the fact that every single component can only return 1 parent element. For example, you cannot use an h1 and a p1 within the same component. 
To achieve being able to use multiple parent elements in 1 component, they must be wrapped in a div, because now we're only returning 1 parent element, in this case the div that they're wrapped in.
Also, a render can only essentially display 1 parent element as well. So if we want to display multiple components, we have to wrap them in a div parent element. Now we can have multiple Bacon components rendered-->
<!--***sidenote that I discovered: even if you comment out certain syntax like components, they are still recognized and can throw an error, I guess because it's in ES6 even though it's being transpiled
*** Also be sure to define components before calling them to be rendered on the DOM, or else they will be undefined.-->
<!--Now properties allow you to customize your components.
A good example of this is if you wanted to make this application like NetFlix, or any application that you wanted to display movies, of course you don't want to make a component to display a movie, and then have to make another different component to display a different movie that had a different title, etc. You would basically want to make the blueprint or a template for one component and customize it in different ways, which is what properties allow you to do.
So you can actually add attributes to the component. In this case we add the title="Avatar" attribute to the Movie component h1 and also a genre="action" attribute to Movie component h2 and we display them by typing them in curly {} braces and accessing them through this.props.___ so for the title, we type this.props.title and also for genre we type this.props.genre
So now if we want to display 5 different movies, we could render 5 different components and each of these components have different properties

EventHandling: Here we'll try to create a "sticky note app" where the user can add new notes, delete or edit notes, sort of like my contactbook app. 
We create a new component via a variable = comment, which is going to essentially a block that will have text on it depending on the comment, which will have a button for editing and deleting it. We'll have some dummy data by putting some static image just to make sure it works and is displayed how we want it to. This whole thing will be in a div, with, in this case, our pre-made style called commentContainer, so for the class name, it's set = to commentContainer. 
Note that we can add attributes in JSX just like we would in normal HTML, however, the reason we can't use class here is because class is already a reserved keyword in JavaScript. Because in JavaScript, class actually means something. So in JSX, we use className. So most of your other attributes will be fine just like normal HTML, but sometimes, if they clash with JavaScript, it could be because of JSX.
So now inside this comment div will be another div which will just be text of whatever, and two buttons.
We'll give the div with text a className of commentText. All it does is it makes it bold and gives some spacing between the text and buttons. Now the button classes, the edit button will have className = button-primary, and the remove button will have className = button-danger, which were already premade. 
Now what we need to do is make something happen whenever the user clicks the buttons. So before we can add an on-click attribute, we actually need to make functions, because essentially we're going to say that whenever you click this, call a function.
Now we already have a function called render, which is the function responsible for displaying HTML. But we can actually make our own custom functions and make them whatever we want. So under the Comment component, we'll make one called edit, which is just equal to a function, which can do whatever we want. Right now, we'll keep thing simple and make an alert pop-up that says "editing comment". We'll also make a remove function with the appropriate pop-up as well.
So right now we have an edit function and a remove function which will display a pop-up whenever they are called. 
Now we need to link the buttons to the functions. We do this by adding another attribute called onClick, keep in mind the curly braces. So how do we do that? Well, since this is a function from the same class, we just need to type this, a dot separator and then the function name, as in this.edit 
The same goes for the remove button.
Now we need to render this. Now we're taking all these comments and surrounding them inside a board div, which is just for styling to give it a color background. So now, whenever we want to write a new comment, it will be in the Comment components.
So now when we click the edit or remove buttons, we get an alert pop-up that states "editing comment" or "removing comment". So now we know that our event handlers are working properly.
Now from here, instead of just having the static text in className ="commentText", we actually want to take whatever text is in between the Comment tags and take that and display it in the "commentText" of the Comment component for the comment. 
So now we have "hey name is Bucky", "Beans" and "Tuna" just to have 3 different comments in the Comment tags. 
So to access the data in the Comment tags to be able to use them in the className="commentText" of the Comment compnonent, remember that any data that is in between the opening tag and closing tags of the Comment components within the className="board" divs are called children. 
Remember that whenever we want to use properties, we just use this.props and then the name of the property as in this.props.children 
So now we change the "Text of whatever" text in between the commentText tags in the Comment component  and replace it with curly braces this.props.children as in {this.props.children}
So the commentText now gets the children, which are the static text in between the Comment tags, and for each Comment component render, displays them in between the div tags with class="commentText".

So in summary, we have done event handling, in which we can create custom functions,and whenever something happens, in this case clicking on the buttons, the functions are called upon by onClick (or some other event handler, however, in this case, we use onClick).
We have also covered how to pass data in between the tags, in this case, the Comment tags, and access them through the children property.

Next is State. States are a way to customize components, which you can also do with properties, however, the difference is that states can change. For example, if you give a component a custom property, whenever you create it, it's set for its life. For example, if you create a button with a property that makes it green, it will be green for the rest of its life. 
Now if you wanted to make a button could change colors everytime the user hovered over it, properties can't be used for that, because their values can't change. Whenever you have a value that needs changing on your component, you need to use state. So basically, whenever you want something to stay the same, you use properties; whenever you want something that changes, you need to use states.
