<!-- first need react.js cdn and also react-dom.js cdn
then we need the babel transpiler because React is written in JSX, JSX is not understood by the browser which only understands JS, so the transpiler translates the JSX into JS to be understood by the browser, in this case an older transpiler of babel 5.8.24 works with this app-->
<!-- script tag where React code will be written will have type="text/babel"
-->
<!--Render basically takes a bit of html and places it into a target where you want to display it, in this case, the id="example"
the first parameter is just html, in this case, h1, this is also basically our React component
the next parameter and the only other one it takes is where we're going to display this, in this case the div with the id of example, via document.GetElementById which will take our React code which in this case is h1 Marco and display into the div with the id of example-->
<!-- Components are just part of the website, anything that's part of a website that's made with React are made with components, so the entire app is made up of components (just different parts of the webpage)
to make a component is via making a variable ___ = React.createClass and inside that is where we actually create the component, since a component is just essentially part of the website, all it is, is pretty much html
so in this case, all it needs to do is return some html, we do this with a function called render, in this case we're returning an h2 component
so whenever we use the component Bacon, it displays an h2
so now we want to substitute the h1 Marco with the component Bacon to display an h2, we literally just substitute the component Bacon in a self-closing tag form <Bacon/> and it will display the h2
so now the component Bacon will the h2 in the target element id="example"
Basically the entire application will be made up of individual parts called components.
At the heart of a component, it essentially just returns a chunk of html-->
<!--Now for returning multiple components...
Be mindful of the fact that every single component can only return 1 parent element. For example, you cannot use an h1 and a p1 within the same component. 
To achieve being able to use multiple parent elements in 1 component, they must be wrapped in a div, because now we're only returning 1 parent element, in this case the div that they're wrapped in.
Also, a render can only essentially display 1 parent element as well. So if we want to display multiple components, we have to wrap them in a div parent element. Now we can have multiple Bacon components rendered-->
<!--***sidenote that I discovered: even if you comment out certain syntax like components, they are still recognized and can throw an error, I guess because it's in ES6 even though it's being transpiled
*** Also be sure to define components before calling them to be rendered on the DOM, or else they will be undefined.-->
<!--Now properties allow you to customize your components.
A good example of this is if you wanted to make this application like NetFlix, or any application that you wanted to display movies, of course you don't want to make a component to display a movie, and then have to make another different component to display a different movie that had a different title, etc. You would basically want to make the blueprint or a template for one component and customize it in different ways, which is what properties allow you to do.
So you can actually add attributes to the component. In this case we add the title="Avatar" attribute to the Movie component h1 and also a genre="action" attribute to Movie component h2 and we display them by typing them in curly {} braces and accessing them through this.props.___ so for the title, we type this.props.title and also for genre we type this.props.genre
So now if we want to display 5 different movies, we could render 5 different components and each of these components have different properties

EventHandling: Here we'll try to create a "sticky note app" where the user can add new notes, delete or edit notes, sort of like my contactbook app. 
We create a new component via a variable = comment, which is going to essentially a block that will have text on it depending on the comment, which will have a button for editing and deleting it. We'll have some dummy data by putting some static image just to make sure it works and is displayed how we want it to. This whole thing will be in a div, with, in this case, our pre-made style called commentContainer, so for the class name, it's set = to commentContainer. 
Note that we can add attributes in JSX just like we would in normal HTML, however, the reason we can't use class here is because class is already a reserved keyword in JavaScript. Because in JavaScript, class actually means something. So in JSX, we use className. So most of your other attributes will be fine just like normal HTML, but sometimes, if they clash with JavaScript, it could be because of JSX.
So now inside this comment div will be another div which will just be text of whatever, and two buttons.
We'll give the div with text a className of commentText. All it does is it makes it bold and gives some spacing between the text and buttons. Now the button classes, the edit button will have className = button-primary, and the remove button will have className = button-danger, which were already premade. 
Now what we need to do is make something happen whenever the user clicks the buttons. So before we can add an on-click attribute, we actually need to make functions, because essentially we're going to say that whenever you click this, call a function.
Now we already have a function called render, which is the function responsible for displaying HTML. But we can actually make our own custom functions and make them whatever we want. So under the Comment component, we'll make one called edit, which is just equal to a function, which can do whatever we want. Right now, we'll keep thing simple and make an alert pop-up that says "editing comment". We'll also make a remove function with the appropriate pop-up as well.
So right now we have an edit function and a remove function which will display a pop-up whenever they are called. 
Now we need to link the buttons to the functions. We do this by adding another attribute called onClick. So how do we do that? Well, since this is a function from the same class, we just need to type this, a dot separator and then the function name, as in this.edit 
The same goes for the remove button.
