<!-- webpack: Before we used to have to make separate files and then load them onto the html separately on their separate script tags. Now it has evolved into module loading systems. 
So beforehand we install Node.JS, then npm init to get a package.json going and then install webpack. Then npm install -g webpack. Then create webpack.config.js, and inside can be a sample start-up webpack. If it's production, if so then we'll run minification, and we won't do source-mapping, if it's not production, then we'll consider it debugging mode and we'll do inline sourcemaps. Our entry point is, in this case, ./js/scripts.js, this is where we're starting off. Our output is the /js folder.
